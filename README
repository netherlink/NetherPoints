Thank you for your interest in NetherPoints by NetherLink! This plugin is meant to
ease travel from place to place by means of teleporters and waypoints.

Installation should be extremely simple. Just download NetherPoints.jar, drop
it into your plugins folder, and reload. Everything should work fine. If you get
a [SEVERE] warning in the console, try dowloading SQLite and placing it in your
CraftBukkit or CraftBukkit/lib folder.

The code is distributed under the MIT License, meaning you can do anything you'd like
with the code. If you want to fork it or embed it in your applications, we'd love a
link or a mention somewhere, but this isn't required. However, any copyright notices
already in place must be left there.

I should point out that in netherpoints.java, the doesTableExist function was taken
from Taylor Kelly in his MyHome plugin and modified for this plugin by TechnoBulldog.
